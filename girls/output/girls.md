## Entering NCVA Tournaments 

Via the NCVA website, if your team has been accepted into a tournament, the NCVA’s goal is to have sites posted and team information by 5:00 PM on the Monday before the event.  Exceptions to this will be tournaments that require USA Volleyball’s seeding information or last minute site cancellations. 

## On-Site at NCVA Tournaments 

- All teams, players and coaches, must arrive at the team’s assigned tournament site at least one (1) hour prior to the scheduled start time for the tournament. Teams that may have a bye for the first match of the day are still required to show up one (1) hour prior to the scheduled start time for the tournament. For example, if the scheduled start time for Power League #2 is 8:00 AM, then your entire team should arrive by 7:00 AM.

## Recruiting Policy  

- The NCVA Girls Division sanctioned season begins on September 1 and concludes on the day after the last day of the USA Junior National Volleyball Championships (JNC).  Regardless of either event, the conclusion of the Girls Division sanctioned season will not extend past July 31st.
- Once a player has committed to a team during the NCVA sanctioned season, club directors and coaches from other NCVA clubs must respect the player’s commitment and cease recruiting the player.  If a recruiter contacts a player who has signed a commitment to another team, the player must notify the recruiter of the commitment.  After notification, the recruiter shall not contact that player or the player’s family.
- A recruiting violation occurs when an NCVA registered club director and/or coach from one (1) NCVA registered club makes initial verbal or written contact with an athlete, or the athlete’s parents, from another NCVA registered club with the intent to persuade the player to leave the present club and join another club.
- The suggested maximum penalty may include, but is not limited to, a monetary fine and/or a suspension of NCVA membership for a period of one (1) year, beginning on the date of the final ruling.
- If a club director or coach is found guilty of committing a recruiting violation, the guilty party may make an appeal.  A special Board of Inquiry Committee will hear the appeal and will make a ruling.  The decision of this Committee will be final.
- If a player or parent makes the initial contact, a club director or coach may answer questions and inform the player or parent about the club’s specific program without fear of committing a recruiting violation.  It is strongly recommended that all club directors and coaches refrain from making negative comments concerning other clubs or their staff.
- A player who has committed to a club and then wishes to transfer to another club must follow the NCVA’s Procedure for Player Transfer.  This is irrespective of the length of a player’s membership with that club.

## Players Turning 18 

Any individual who is not yet 18 years old and who is in a player role affiliated with a junior club must complete the required Safesport certification online immediately upon reaching 18 years of age.  

## Players Enrolled in Collegiate Athletics

A 30-day grace period shall apply from the date of the 18th birthday in order to allow time for the background screening to be processed. During the 30-day grace period the same restrictions apply to the individual and should be enforced as are in place for junior coaches regarding supervision by a qualified adult.

## Club to Club Player Transfer 

Junior players are eligible to play for any club or team until the start of the NCVA sanctioned season, which begins on November 1st.

Each district is automatically allocated two (2) positions in each division. Additional positions are then allocated based on the finish of that district’s teams in the past season and the size of the district, as outlined below.

How we calculate the number of positions allocated to each District:

1. Each District receives two positions automatically. 
2. Each District receives additional positions based on the number of teams from that District that made it to the top 24 teams the previous season: 

    | Number of Teams in District | Number of Additional Bids |
    | --- | --- |
    | >12 | 1 |
    | >18 | 2 |
    | >24 | 3 |
    | >30 | 4 |

3. Each district receives additional positions based on the number of teams in that district:

    | Number of Teams in top 24 | Number of Additional Bids |
    | --- | --- |
    | 0 | 0 |
    | 2 | 1 |
    | 4 | 2 |
    | 6 | 3 |

4. Remaining positions are awarded to the Districts in a round robin method, starting with the largest districts, until all positions have been awarded. 

<br><br>

Here is the breakdown, by Age Group, of the number of positions allocated to each district.

The last few divisions of a Challenger Section age group will have a random number of teams. 

<br><br>

## Power League Regional Championship Section 

- The Championship Section will consist of 36 teams divided into three divisions (Gold, Silver, and Bronze).
- Each division will have 12 teams playing on three (3) or four (4) courts.  The top three (3) finishing teams in each League tournament (Leagues #1, #2, and #3) will move up one (1) division and the three (3) lowest finishing teams will move down one (1) division.

<br><br>

## Power League Regional Challenger Section  

- The Challenger Section will consist of as many divisions as necessary to accommodate all teams that have entered.  The NCVA reserves the right to change the number of teams in a division to better accommodate the number of teams entered in any age group, and to allow the use of more two (2) court facilities.
- Each division will begin with Gold, Silver Bronze divisions followed by the corresponding alphabet by color (Aqua, Blue, Copper, Dusk, etc.) with the higher levels corresponding to the beginning of the alphabet.
- Each division will play on two (2), three (3), or four (4) courts.
- The top three (3) finishing teams in each League tournament (#1, #2 and #3) will move up one (1) division and the three (3) lowest finishing teams will move down one (1) division.  For example, a Bronze division team that finishes tenth, eleventh, or twelfth in a League tournament will move to the Aqua division for its next tournament. Likewise, a team finishing first, second, or third in the Aqua division will move to the Bronze division up to and including League #3.

## Power League Qualifier Seeding 

Placement into the 2022 Power League is determined by Power League Qualifier Finish. Every team in the Power League Qualifier will have an opportunity on the court to reach the Gold, Silver or Bronze Division. Teams will play in their specific age group for the Power League Qualifier - 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11. Teams will be seeded based on their points in 2021. Teams without 2021 Power League points will initially be seeded after those with 2022 points. Any team that believes a seed is significantly incorrect may submit a seeding appeal. Please see forms section of this handbook.   Your written appeal will be considered by NCVA if your appeal states compelling reasons of why your team is miss-seeded and the appropriate calculations for a different seed may occur.  

### Initial Seeding 

- Teams will be seeded based on their points from the 2021 Power League.
- Teams will be ranked according to the points in their previous age groups. For example, 18s team will be seeded according to their finish as 17s team.
- All teams who did not have a corresponding team in 2021 will be seeded at the bottom of the division. 
- 11’s teams will be seeded based on the 2021 points of their club’s 12s teams.

### Appeals 

- Teams that believe that they are significantly mis-seeded must submit a written appeal to the NCVA Office by January 19, 2021 by 5:00 PM.
- You must turn in the Appeals Form by this date. This form can be found on the NCVA website -  www.ncva.com – under the Forms section of this handbook.

**Examples of teams that have appropriate reasons to appeal:**

- An 18s team that had many High School Juniors in 2021 and is thus better represented by their finish in the 18s division.
- A team that is comprised of many players who played with a different club in 2021.

Once the seeding is released for appeals, the ceiling/cap will be removed from the seeded and unseeded teams.  Based on the appeal, team(s) may be moved accordingly. Appeals should only be submitted when a team’s seeding may be incorrect by at least 35% of the divisions seeding.   

This percentage translates to these approximations: 

| Age Division | Approximate Number of Seeds Represented by 35% |
| --- | --- |
| 12 | 8 |
| 13 | 19 |
| 14 | 31 |
| 15 | 30 |
| 16 | 41 |
| 17 | 19 |
| 18 | 23 |

- A written appeal must include specific documentation, including names of players.
- Any attempt to criticize another team or suggest that a seed is too high based on opinion only will result in the appeal being disregarded.  However, if you have significant documentation and facts, you can use them in your appeal.
- Appeal forms will only be reviewed if received by the deadline.
- All appeals will be considered if they meet the guidelines.
- The written appeals will be reviewed and a final seeding for the Power League Qualifier will be posted by, January 26, 2021 at 5:00 PM.

In order to preserve the integrity of the seeding process, NCVA may, at its sole discretion, re-seed teams that did not submit appeals. 


### Unseeded Teams 

For the 2021 - 2022, season these teams will be seeded from the same age group from last season. Example: If your club has a 16-1 team playing in the 2022 season but did not have a 15-1 team, this 16-1 team would be considered “unseeded” team. For the 2021 - 2022, season this “un-seeded” team will be seeded within in the “unseeded” teams based on the club’s 16-1 finish. 

For the 2021 - 2022 season, the California Kickoff Tournament will be seeded based on the above information.  All unseeded teams will be re-seeded, following California Kickoff based on the criteria below, by the NCVA for a final seeding of the Power League Qualifier for 2021 - 2022.

Teams wishing to use their California Kickoff Results for seeding into the seeded teams for the Power League must participate in the Open Division.  California Kickoff Head-to-Head Results for teams participating in the Club Division will only move their team within the unseeded teams. 

### Appeal Deadlines

### Post Qualifier Seeding 

Teams will be seeded based on their Power League Qualifier finish.  

<br><br>

## Power League Region Championships

The Power League Region Championships seeding will be determined following Power League #3 finish. Teams will receive their Power League #3 points first, then (#1, #2 and #3) will move up one (1) division and the three lowest finishing teams will move down one (1) division. For example, a Bronze division team that finishes tenth, eleventh, or twelfth in a League tournament will move to the Aqua division for its next tournament. Likewise, a team finishing first, second, or third in the Aqua division will move to the Bronze division. Once the movement is complete and the divisions are determined (Top 36 for Championship, next 36 for Challenger, and so on), teams will be seeded within their division at the Region Championships based on points. All teams will play teams in their age group. (i.e 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, and 11)  

<br><br>

## Region Championship Seeding Procedure  

1. Following Power League #3, movement will occur in all age groups. i.e. three (3) teams move up and three (3) teams move down a division.  
2. Region Championship Divisions are decided: Championship (Seeds 1-36), Challenger 1 Division (36-72), Challenger 2 Division (73-108), etc.  
3. Each Division within an age group will be seeded by points.  
4. Challenger Divisions will vary in the amount of teams in each division.

## Switching Leagues 

A team may choose to play in the Power League and in Non-League tournaments, or in the Premier League and in Non-League tournaments.  A team may not play in both Power League tournaments and Premier League tournaments concurrently in the same season.  However, a team may switch Leagues once during the season according to the regulations below.  

### Switching from Premier League to Power League (Team) 

- If a team plays in a Premier League tournament and decides it would rather play in the Power League, the team will be allowed to enter the Power League at the lowest level and only on a space-available basis.
- The cost of entry will be $1,600.00, paid in full before the next scheduled Power League event.  If you have already paid for the $1,200.00 Premier League entry fee, the team will owe an additional $400.00.
- A team that switches from the Premier League to the Power League may not switch back to the Premier League.
- Points earned by the team while participating in the Premier League will not be transferred to the Power League.

_Premier League Teams cannot switch to Power League following Power League #3._



### Switching from Power League to Premier League (Team) 

- If a team plays in the Power League Qualifier and decides it would rather play in the Premier League, the team will be allowed to enter the Premier League at that time following the Qualifier.
- The team will not receive a refund for the Power League, but will not have to pay an additional fee for the Premier League.
- A team that switches from the Power League to the Premier League may not switch back to the Power League.
- Points earned by the team while participating in the Power League will not be transferred to the Premier League. 

_Power League Teams cannot switch to Premier League following Power League #3._

<br><br>

## Warm-Ups 

- Teams will be given sole use of the court for five (5) minutes prior to their first match of the day.  During the five (5) minutes the team may hit, practice ball handling and serve (serving must be done during their five (5) minutes).  No other time will be allotted to practice serving.
  - Serving Team – five (5) minutes solo court.
  - Receiving Team – five (5) minute solo court.
- Once all teams in the pool have played, the teams scheduled to play the next match will be given sole use of the court for three (3) minutes.  During the three (3) minutes the team may hit, practice ball handling and serve (serving must be done during their three (3) min.)  No other time will be allotted to practice serving.  
- **Rule 7.2.2b**: “For junior competition, when one team has exclusive use of the court, the other team must either be at its team bench or out of the playing area.  Warming up with balls at the team bench or the spectator walkways is not permitted.”
- Since no ball handling is permitted during the opposing team’s use of the court, it is recommended that each team provides shaggers for the opposing team’s warm-up.  This allows for more reps for the team warming up.  Due to insurance and liability requirements only NCVA registered and on the roster personnel will be allowed to retrieve balls.

<br><br>

## Tie-Breaking Procedure 
<br>

### **Two (2) Way Ties**

Two (2) way ties, in match record, in a pool are broken by head-to-head competition results between the two (2) tied teams. 

### **Three (3) Way Ties**

Three (3) way ties in a pool are broken by: 

||||
|---|---|---|
| 1st | Matches | Won/Lost Record |
| 2nd | Sets | Won/lost percentage.  Calculation:  the team’s total number of sets won divided by the team’s total number of sets played equals the won/lost percentage. The highest percentage wins the pool. |
| 3rd | Point Differential | Determined among the tied teams.  Calculation:  the team’s total points scored minus the team’s total points allowed in ALL the matches of the pool. |

**Note:**  If three teams have the same match record but a different set record, only the teams with identical set records are tied. If match record and set record are the same for all three teams, then point differential will be used to break the tie. 


<br><br>

## Protests  

If an explanation of an application or interpretation of a rule is not satisfactory to the game, captain, he/she must immediately indicate his/her disagreement and file a protest prior to the authorization of the next service.  If the disagreement with the referee’s explanation involves the last point of the set, the official protest must be recorded within the first 60 seconds of the times interval between sets. (For 14-and-under competition, the coach may act instead of the captain.) A protest must be called prior to a player going to a tournament director or head official. A parent is not allowed to call a protest.  

- If the final point of the match is disputed, the protest must be recorded before the referees leave the playing area. (Appointed NCVA Protest Committee/Tournament Director either immediately or prior to the start of the next set).
- It is advisable to have an assigned Protest Committee (Tournament Director) available to rule upon a protest as soon as possible prior to the first service following the protest.  Such action should preclude playing the match over from the point of protest if the protest is upheld.


 
### Protests considered by the first referee (Protest Committee or Tournament Director) include: 

1. Misinterpretation of a playing rule.
2. Failure of the first referee to apply the correct rule to a given situation.
3. Failure to charge the correct penalty-sanction for a given fault.

### Protest facts recorded on the score sheet include the: 

1. Score of the set at the time of the protest.
2. Players and positions at the time of the protest.
3. Player substitutions and team substitutions made up to the protest.
4. Team time-outs taken up to the protest.
5. Situation that caused the protest.
6. Signatures of the scorer, captains and first referee, indicating the facts are correct.

**Coaches may not protest judgement calls.**

<br><br>

# **Club Tryouts**

## Parent / Player Guidelines 

### What should a player and his parents expect from a club at tryouts?  

You have the right to make an informed decision.  Since your decision is binding for the full season, you should make your choice carefully.

You should be wary of any club that tries to convince you to join while denying you information.

We recommend that you receive the information in writing.

At the very least, you are entitled to the following information from the clubs:

- The opportunity to talk to parents, other players, and/or other programs.
- The opportunity to try out in a future season without discrimination.
- Knowledge about how many spots are available before a tryout begins.
- Clear disclosure of financial obligations.
- A statement of club philosophy.
- Have any questions answered.
- An assessment of your role on the team.
- Disclosure of other players who have accepted and/or been offered spots.
- Information on the coaching staff.
- Description of the teams, goals, practice schedule, and tournament schedule.
- Try out for more than one club.
- Time Commitment.
- Travel Commitment.
- Travel Policy for overnight stay.
- Social Media Guidelines.
- SafeSport Guidelines.

Parents - you may view our Parents link located on the NCVA homepage on the top tool bar for general information, in the Parents Handbook.

Make sure you are aware of all recruiting rules and regulations following your commitment to your club.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Northern California office at **(415) 550-7582** or email us at help@ncva.com.

All players attending NCVA Sanctioned tryouts must have a full membership ($70.00) or a tryout pass ($20.00). Tryout passes are good for all tryouts that a player attends.

To attend NCVA Sanctioned tryouts, you need to register online with NCVA.

# Impact and SafeSport

## IMPACT 
USA Volleyball SafeSport requires all participating coaches listed on the roster must be IMPACT and SafeSport Certified.  The NCVA also recommends that parents and spectators complete SafeSport.  

The primary IMPACT goal is to help all coaches understand and become well-skilled in the awesome responsibility and incredible opportunity they have to influence young people positively through the sport of volleyball.  This course is an offshoot of the Coaching Accreditation Program (CAP), which is under the auspices of the USA Volleyball branch of Educational Programs and Services. 

## SafeSport 
The NCVA would like to assist all coaches in becoming responsible and respectful coaches.   

All 2021 - 2022 IMPACT and SafeSport classes will be completed online.  Please visit the link below to sign up for the USA Volleyball ON-DEMAND courses. 

- [The Center for SafeSport](http://safesport.org/)

We all have a role to play in providing a healthy setting for our sport. The SafeSport Program raises awareness about possible misconduct in our sport, promotes open dialogue and provides training and resources. When we work as a team, we can build a plan to make volleyball safe – for everyone. 

USA Volleyball is committed to fostering a fun, healthy and safe sport environment for all its members. We must recognize that the safety of minors lies with all those involved in the sport and is not the sole responsibility of any one person at the club, regional or national level.

The USA Volleyball SafeSport Program raises awareness about possible misconduct in our sport, promotes open dialogue and provides training and resources. When we work as a team, we can build a plan to make volleyball safe – for everyone. 

USA Volleyball members should use the policies, guidelines, best practices, strategies and tools available to implement SafeSport practices at the local level. Together we can provide a safe environment for all members to enjoy the sport of volleyball. 

Starting September 1, 2020, the below courses will be available in the USAV Clinics to register for the upcoming season.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# Officiating

Teams will be responsible for providing the first referee, second referee, two (2) line judges, and three (3) scorekeepers.   If a League tournament (including Qualifier and Regionals) does not have paid certified officials, the teams must officiate the matches. 

- Coaches are required to be part of the officiating crew when their team is assigned to officiate a match.  All coaches, unless acting as a line judge or R2, must be present at the scoring table.  While their team is officiating, all coaches must be actively attentive, listening to what is occurring around the court to make sure the score is kept accurately and all players are performing their duties appropriately.  Coaches failing to fulfill this role for their team will subject them to incomplete officiating team sanctions which consists of forfeiting a point a minute, up to 25 points, in the first set of the next match.  If this is the last match of the day, please refer to the sanctions section for additional information. 
- All players attending the USAV Junior National Volleyball Championships must fulfill any additional requirements as set forth by the Competition Committee of USA Volleyball.  The NCVA will be providing raters during the Power League Region Championship ONLY.  To have your team rated, please complete the form in the National Events section of this Handbook and send it to the NCVA Office.  For more information on this topic, see the National Events section of this Handbook or check USA Volleyball’s website (www.usavolleyball.org). 

All players, coaches, parents are required to attend a rules clinic to play in the NCVA Girls League Tournaments.

## Officiating 

It has been the policy of the Northern California Volleyball Association, NCVA Board of Directors, the NCVA office staff, and the Officials Advisory Group that during league play tournaments: 

- Club coaches work as the first referee.
- Have junior players that have been through the Junior Officials training program as the first referee. 
- If you do not have a player that has been through the program, the head coach must be the first referee.

# Codes of Conducts and Sanctions

## Codes of Conduct
THe NCVA and USAV Codes of Conduct are provided as downloadable PDFs.

- [Member Code of Conduct](http://ncva.com/downloads/USAV%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf)
- [Spectator/Parent Code of Conduct](http://ncva.com/downloads/Spectator%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf)
- [NCVA Code of Behavior](http://ncva.com/downloads/Code%20of%20Behavior.pdf)

## What is a Sanctioned Event? 

Sanctioned events are tryouts, clinics, open gyms, and other club affiliated events that have been approved by NCVA/USAV. These events are governed by the policies set by NCVA/USAV and are covered by the USA Volleyball insurance policy. 

Sanctioned events are required to submit a list of all adults attending each event. These adults are mandated to meet the minimum coaching requirements which include: IMPACT certification, bi-annual SafeSport certification, and bi-annual background screening. Adults failing to meet these requirements are not approved to be present as a participant at the sanctioned event. 

Sanctioned events must also confirm that all participants attending, both adult and junior levels, have a valid membership for the duration of the event. If the event falls over multiple days/weekends, the membership must be valid for the entire time. 

## What is a Non-Sanctioned Event?

Many clubs/teams receive invitations to events hosted by other clubs/teams that are not sanctioned by NCVA and/or USA Volleyball. This indicates they have not requested/been approved for sanctioning and are not covered by USAV policies and insurance. Teams that participate in non-NCVA sanctioned events are playing without USA Volleyball insurance coverage.

Any complaints/claims that would arise, including but not limited to code of conduct violations, code of ethics violations, sexual misconduct, and injury, would fall on the event organizers and/or participants of the event.

Sanctioned competition protects a player’s eligibility for participation in regional, zonal, national, and international competition. For anyone participating, please be diligent in reviewing insurance, waivers and release of liability guidelines beforehand.

## Sanctions

### Sanction Penalty Grid
To view the current seasons Sanctions Penalty Grid, please [click here](http://ncva.com/downloads/2020.2021%20Sanction%20Grid.pdf).

### Background
There has been sufficient abuse of competition privileges by teams in past years to warrant a list of published penalties or sanctions.  The ramifications of these abuses are that gym sites or formats have to be altered at the very last minute.  This has led to lessening the quality of tournaments for those teams who remain involved.  The following sanctions are meant to curtail the cavalier use of the junior tournament structure and to enhance tournament play for all teams. 

### Exceptions
Teams having to cancel from a tournament or that are unable to get to a tournament site due to acts of God and/or weather conditions and road closures will not be sanctioned which will be determined by the NCVA Office.  Teams should notify the NCVA Office, in writing, if this type of situation becomes applicable to them.

### To Cancel from a League or Non-League Tournament 
A team canceling 14 days or more prior to a tournament will not receive a sanction. However, if you cancel 13 days or less prior to the tournament, you will lose your entry fee and possibly other sanctions may apply, see below.  No refunds are given for cancellations out of power league.  You must complete the [online tournament cancellation form](http://ncva.com/tournamentcancellation/).

### Sanction Payments 
All fines must be paid before the sanctioned team/participant may enter into their next NCVA event.  Please be aware of these penalties and take care of them as soon as possible.

### Teams leaving multi-day tournaments early and failing to fulfill all officiating assignments 
Teams that have no flexibility in their travel plans and know they will need to leave before their division completes play will report to the Tournament Director no later than the end of play on the day prior to the final day of Tournament. 

Failure to report to the Tournament Director no later than the end of play on the day prior to the final day of Tournament will result in a team sanction. This sanction will be in the amount of **$350**. This sanction will be reported to USA Volleyball and teams will not be able to participate in any future events until paid.  

 
### Illegal Player 
An illegal player is one who:  
- Competes under elements of false identification such as name, birth date, club affiliation, etc.
- Competes, but is not registered with the NCVA.
- Competes on two (2) teams in the same tournament. In one (1) event occurs over multiple weekends, a player may only participate on one (1) weekend/division.
- Competes in an event with another team while the player’s original team is being sanctioned for an offense.
  - Illegal players, the team coach, and the club director will fall under the guidelines of the due process procedure. Penalties may range from but are not limited to, immediate suspension of an individual to the suspension of the entire club and monetary fines.


### Age Falsification  
For all NCVA events, any person who alters any document that certifies the age of a participant, or falsifies any statement that lists the age of a participant, will be sanctioned according to the terms listed below. 

Any team representative, coach, club director, or responsible adult who is found to be party to age falsification shall be: 
1. Immediately suspended from registration with NCVA/USA and barred from further participation in the event; and
2. Barred from participation in any NCVA/USA events in any capacity for a minimum of two (2) years; and 
3. Placed on a minimum probation of one additional year, to run consecutively to the suspension. 

Junior players who knowingly play in lower age classifications than which they are eligible or adult players who knowingly play in higher age classifications than which they are eligible shall be: 
1. Immediately suspended from registration with NCVA/USA and barred from further participation in the event; and 
2. Barred from participation in any NCVA/USA events in any capacity for a minimum of two (2) years; and 
3. Placed on a minimum probation of one additional year, to run consecutively to the suspension. 


## Violating NCVA Tryout and Commitment Policies 

The following sanctions apply directly to the person(s) violating the policy. 

### First Offense 
Suspension from All NCVA/USA competition for a minimum of one (1) week up to a maximum of one (1) month, depending on the severity of the violation. 

Multiple offenses arising from the same incident (for example, multiple players on the same team violate the same policy) will incur separate penalties for each offender. 

### Second Offense 
Suspension from All NCVA/USA competition for a minimum of one (1) month up to a maximum of one (1) year, depending on the severity of the violation. 

Multiple offenses arising from the same incident (for example, multiple players on the same team violate the same policy) will incur separate penalties for each offender. 

All suspensions being on the date of the first competition following the violation for the penalized person(s). All sanctions begin with the first tournament of the season. If any person fails to adhere to the terms of the sanction, the individual will be suspended from NCVA competition and Nation events for one calendar year and subject to a lifetime ban. Further, the coaching staff of the team on which the person is registered will be suspended from NCVA competition and National events for one (1) calendar year and subject to a lifetime ban. If the individual is the club director, all coaches in the club will be suspended from NCVA competition and National events for one (1) calendar year and subject to a lifetime ban. 


## Violating the Code of Conduct 
Any participants/attendees found in violation of the code of conduct will be required to attend a behavioral seminar, determined by NCVA, in addition to any other sanctions that may be assessed. Attendance and completion of the behavioral seminar will be at the expense of the person in violation of the code of conduct. Completion of the required behavioral seminar will be required before the person may participate in or attend any future events.  

## Food in the Playing Facility / Failure to Follow Facility Rules 
Tournament directors may impose the “13-Point Rule” for teams who are violating the “No Food in Gym” policy.  The “13-Point Rule” means that in the team’s next set, the score will begin at 0-13, with 13 points automatically awarded to the opposing team.  This will be noted in the tournament director’s report, which will result in the club’s being fined a minimum of $200 and receive the last place finish/points if they apply. During the tournaments located in Convention Centers, if your team is caught with food you may be removed from the tournament. 

## Late for an Officiating Assignment 
Tournament directors may impose the following sanction for teams who are late for and/or miss an officiating assignment. Your team’s opponent will be awarded a point a minute for each minute you are late to your officiating assignment, up to 25 points (one set). If this is the last match of the day, then the team will be fined $100.00. 

## League Commitment 
Once a team has committed to play in the League, the team is automatically entered into each League date.  If a team cannot attend a League tournament, the team must still cancel from the tournament by mailing, delivering, faxing, or emailing the Tournament Cancellation Form, using the criteria stated in this Handbook.  The club will not receive a refund for the canceled tournament.  The team will be placed as the last finisher in that tournament and receive last place points.  The team will be dropped to the next division, depending on the League structure.  There are no refunds and sanctions may occur if your team does not cancel in the allotted time.  

## Additional Sanctions 
Specific sanctions are mentioned and described in various sections of this Handbook, and in some cases, a specific penalty is associated with a particular violation.  In addition, NCVA has the right to impose sanctions with respect to any violation of any other part of this Handbook, or any violation of USA Volleyball’s Code of Ethics, Code of Conduct, Participant Code of Conduct, Eligibility Rules, Substance Abuse Policy, or other policy, as well as any other indiscretions not specifically covered in this Handbook or policies of NCVA or USA Volleyball.  The extent and type of sanctions imposed shall be at the sole discretion of the NCVA, subject to the due process procedures described herein. 

## Sanction Procedure 
Confirmation of missed officiating assignments, forfeiture of matches, food/drink violations, no-shows, use of illegal players, or any other violations that come to the attention of the tournament director will be communicated by the tournament director to the NCVA Office.  The tournament director will also record all offenses on the appropriate forms.  After the event in question, the NCVA Office will confirm the offense(s) with the club director and sanctions will be imposed if appropriate.  The NCVA Office will record all offenses in the team's folder. 

## Sanction Appeal Process 
Any sanction that does not involve probation, suspension of any duration, or expulsion (severe sanction) shall take effect as soon as it is imposed either by the tournament director or the NCVA office.  Any club director or participant who is penalized with a sanction that is not a severe sanction shall have the right to appeal the sanction, by the earlier of either the seventh day after receiving the sanction or the club's or participant's next scheduled event, whichever is first.  An appeal shall consist of a letter from the club or participant who has been sanctioned along with any other materials the club or participant chooses to provide.  Appeals of non-severe sanctions shall be considered, as soon as reasonably practicable by the NCVA Office, in consultation with the tournament director.  NCVA shall provide the club director or participant with written notice of its decision, and there will be no further appeal of the matter. 

Sanctions involving facility rules/policies such as food policies will not be required to identify the persons and/or specific team incurring the sanction. The Tournament Director will determine the club affiliation for the sanction. These Sanctions may not be appealed based on questions regarding the person and/or specific team involved in the incident. While the Tournament Director may choose to notify the Club Director on site at events in Convention Centers, it is not mandatory to do so. The Tournament Director is not required to give a warning for these Sanctions at any time.  

Severe sanctions will be handled under NCVA's due process procedures.

## Sitting Volleyball: Frequently Asked Questions 

<div class="faqcontainer">

**Can you play in a wheelchair?** 

Technically, no, but what happens if in play? Maybe the response to the situation is come and try. 

**Can I get hurt?**

Yes, it is possible. As with all sports, things can happen. Best practices are to follow rules and create a safe environment for play.

Yes, it is possible. Using preventative measures can help by wearing long pants, socks, and knee and elbow pads.

**Can I play with my prosthetic limb?**

It depends, if wearing a prosthetic arm, the answer is yes. You can use it to pass, serve, and block. A prosthetic leg is very hard and has immovable parts. If an athlete or teammate falls on it, it could cause injury to them or damage the prosthetic. 

**What if I have never coached or played Volleyball before?**

Your primary role is to be a strong leader and to help strengthen and develop character; technical and tactical knowledge comes with time. Take advantage of on-court learning opportunities. 

**What if I’ve coached standing volleyball but never sitting volleyball?**

The rule differences are very minimal, if you are able to coach the standing game, you will have no trouble at all coaching sitting volleyball. 

**Should I still offer a sitting Volleyball program if no athletes are interested?**

Yes! Your school could provide a much-needed competition for other schools that do have adaptive athletes on their sitting volleyball team. You are also helping to spread the word about adaptive sports and raise awareness.  Last, remember, anyone can play sitting Volleyball.
