## Premier League Region Championships <span class="--needsediting">Just Pure Points?</span>
The Premier League Region Championships will be broken into 48 team divisions [Gold (1-48), Silver (49-96), Bronze (97-144), and so on]. Each District will be allocated positions in each division. Each district is automatically allocated two (2) positions in each division. Additional positions are then allocated based on the finish of that district’s teams in the past season and the size of the district, as outlined below.

{{pagebreak}}

<span class="--needsediting">TOO COMPLICATED</span>

How we calculate the number of positions allocated to each District:

1. Each District receives two positions automatically. 
2. Each District receives additional positions based on the number of teams from that District that made it to the top 24 teams the previous season: 

  | Number of Teams in District | Number of Additional Bids |
  | --- | --- |
  | >12 | 1 |
  | >18 | 2 |
  | >24 | 3 |
  | >30 | 4 |

3. Each district receives additional positions based on the number of teams in that district:

  | Number of Teams in top 24 | Number of Additional Bids |
  | --- | --- |
  | 0 | 0 |
  | 2 | 1 |
  | 4 | 2 |
  | 6 | 3 |

4. Remaining positions are awarded to the Districts in a round robin method, starting with the largest districts, until all positions have been awarded. 

Here is the breakdown, by Age Group, of the number of positions allocated to each district.

|||||
|---|---|---|---|

The last few divisions of a Challenger Section age group will have a random number of teams. 

## Power League Regional Championship Section 
- The Championship Section will consist of 36 teams divided into three divisions (Gold, Silver, and Bronze).
- Each division will have 12 teams playing on three (3) or four (4) courts. The top three (3) finishing teams in each League tournament (Leagues #1, #2, and #3) will move up one (1) division and the three (3) lowest finishing teams will move down one (1) division.

## Power League Regional Challenger Section 
- The Challenger Section will consist of as many divisions as necessary to accommodate all teams that have entered. The NCVA reserves the right to change the number of teams in a division to better accommodate the number of teams entered in any age group, and to allow the use of more two (2) court facilities.
- Each division will begin with Gold, Silver Bronze divisions followed by the corresponding alphabet by color (Aqua, Blue, Copper, Dusk, etc.) with the higher levels corresponding to the beginning of the alphabet.
- Each division will play on two (2), three (3), or four (4) courts.
- The top three (3) finishing teams in each League tournament (#1, #2 and #3) will move up one (1) division and the three (3) lowest finishing teams will move down one (1) division. For example, a Bronze division team that finishes tenth, eleventh, or twelfth in a League tournament will move to the Aqua division for its next tournament. Likewise, a team finishing first, second, or third in the Aqua division will move to the Bronze division up to and including League #3.

## Power League Qualifier Seeding 
Placement into the {{season_year}} Power League is determined by Power League Qualifier Finish. Every team in the Power League Qualifier will have an opportunity on the court to reach the Gold, Silver or Bronze Division. Teams will play in their specific age group for the Power League Qualifier - 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11. Teams will be seeded based on their points in {{previous_year}}. Teams without {{previous_year}} Power League points will initially be seeded after those with {{season_year}} points. Any team that believes a seed is significantly incorrect may submit a seeding appeal. Please see forms section of this handbook.  Your written appeal will be considered by NCVA if your appeal states compelling reasons of why your team is miss-seeded and the appropriate calculations for a different seed may occur. 

### Initial Seeding 
- Teams will be seeded based on their points from the {{previous_year}} Power League.
- Teams will be ranked according to the points in their previous age groups. For example, 18s team will be seeded according to their finish as 17s team.
- All teams who did not have a corresponding team in {{previous_year}} will be seeded at the bottom of the division. 
- 11s teams will be seeded based on the {{previous_year}} points of their club’s 12s teams.

### Appeals 
- Teams that believe that they are significantly mis-seeded must submit a written appeal to the NCVA Office by {{deadline_seeding_appeal_powerleague}}.
- You must turn in the Appeals Form by this date. This form can be found on the NCVA website - www.ncva.com – under the Forms section of this handbook.

**Examples of teams that have appropriate reasons to appeal:**
- An 18s team that had many High School Juniors in {{previous_year}} and is thus better represented by their finish in the 18s division.
- A team that is comprised of many players who played with a different club in {{previous_year}}.

Once the seeding is released for appeals, the ceiling/cap will be removed from the seeded and unseeded teams. Based on the appeal, team(s) may be moved accordingly. Appeals should only be submitted when a team’s seeding may be incorrect by at least 35% of the divisions seeding.  

This percentage translates to these approximations: 

| Age Division | Approximate Number of Seeds Represented by 35% |
| --- | --- |
| 12 | 8 |
| 13 | 19 |
| 14 | 31 |
| 15 | 30 |
| 16 | 41 |
| 17 | 19 |
| 18 | 23 |

- A written appeal must include specific documentation, including names of players.
- Any attempt to criticize another team or suggest that a seed is too high based on opinion only will result in the appeal being disregarded. However, if you have significant documentation and facts, you can use them in your appeal.
- Appeal forms will only be reviewed if received by the deadline.
- All appeals will be considered if they meet the guidelines.
- The written appeals will be reviewed and a final seeding for the Power League Qualifier will be posted by, {{date_final_seeding}}.

In order to preserve the integrity of the seeding process, NCVA may, at its sole discretion, re-seed teams that did not submit appeals. 


### Unseeded Teams 
For the {{season_year_range}}, season these teams will be seeded from the same age group from last season. Example: If your club has a 16-1 team playing in the {{season_year}} season but did not have a 15-1 team, this 16-1 team would be considered “unseeded” team. For the {{season_year_range}}, season this “un-seeded” team will be seeded within in the “unseeded” teams based on the club’s 16-1 finish. 

For the {{season_year_range}} season, the California Kickoff Tournament will be seeded based on the above information. All unseeded teams will be re-seeded, following California Kickoff based on the criteria below, by the NCVA for a final seeding of the Power League Qualifier for {{season_year_range}}.

Teams wishing to use their California Kickoff Results for seeding into the seeded teams for the Power League must participate in the Open Division. California Kickoff Head-to-Head Results for teams participating in the Club Division will only move their team within the unseeded teams. 

### Appeal Deadlines
- Deadline to appeal for California Kickoff: **{{deadline_seeding_appeal_kickoff}}**
- Teams who can submit this form are: 
  - All teams can appeal their seeding for the California Kickoff 
  - This appeal will be used for the Power League Qualifier 
- Deadline to appeal for Power League Qualifier: **{{deadline_seeding_appeal_powerleague}}**

## Power Leagues #1, #2 and #3 
Following the Power League Qualifier, teams will remain in their specific age groups to play in League #1, #2 and #3. (i.e. 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, and 11) 

### Post Qualifier Seeding 
Teams will be seeded based on their Power League Qualifier finish. 

## Power League Region Championships
The Power League Region Championships seeding will be determined following Power League #3 finish. Teams will receive their Power League #3 points first, then (#1, #2 and #3) will move up one (1) division and the three lowest finishing teams will move down one (1) division. For example, a Bronze division team that finishes tenth, eleventh, or twelfth in a League tournament will move to the Aqua division for its next tournament. Likewise, a team finishing first, second, or third in the Aqua division will move to the Bronze division. Once the movement is complete and the divisions are determined (Top 36 for Championship, next 36 for Challenger, and so on), teams will be seeded within their division at the Region Championships based on points. All teams will play teams in their age group. (i.e 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, and 11) 

## Region Championship Seeding Procedure 
1. Following Power League #3, movement will occur in all age groups. i.e. three (3) teams move up and three (3) teams move down a division. 
2. Region Championship Divisions are decided: Championship (Seeds 1-36), Challenger 1 Division (36-72), Challenger 2 Division (73-108), etc.
