1.	**All CAPITAL letters** throughout the score sheet.
2.	ALL information prior to the first serve and after the last point should be in **pen**.
3.	In the **Officials** section, use **Last Name, First Name**.
4.	Tournament Date should be **six** (6) characters, **mm/dd/yy** (example: 09/18/05).
5.	All **times** should be in **international time** (e.g. 9am = 0900, 2:15pm = 1415).
6.	After the coin toss, place an “X” in three places (can be done for both sets):
    1. Through the encircled **(S)** of the serving team.
    2. Through the encircled **\(R\)** of the receiving team.
    3. In **Service Rounds** box 1 for the Position I player of Receiving team.
7.	You may use **pencil** from the first serve until final point is recorded.
8.	Make a small **check mark** over the number in the Service Rounds box for each player’s **first serve** (if legal serve).
**Exceptions:**
    1. Wrong server 
    2. set point awarded to receiving team on loss of rally 
    3. In a deciding set, at the change of courts
         * When team on left serves point 8, use a check mark on far left and transfer the last exit score from the previous server from the far left to the far right; no exit score is recorded in far left box, final exit score is recorded in far right box.
         * When the team on the right earns point 8, or the team on the left earns point 8 on a loss of rally, transfer the last exit score from the previous server from the far left to the far right.
9. **Three** actions on **Substitution**: 
     1. Slash the player #, replace with substituting player #.
     2. Enter the Score at Change (sub team score first).
     3. Slash the team sub.
10.	After the **last point** is recorded (begin using pen): 
    1.	Record **end** time in **International Time**.
    2.	Circle **both** final **exit scores** (Service Rounds section **only**).
    3.	Record team names and scores of set in **Results** section.
    4.	Hourglass unused points in the Points column for both teams (see example image below).
    5.	Check score sheet for errors and proper count of substitutions.
    6.	**Sign** score sheet **after** all information has been **verified**.
    7.	Obtain Captain/Coach signatures, then offer to 1st referee for **signature**.
