## Officials Levels
For the purposes of developing officials in the region and to recognize levels of competencies, the following levels have been established.  Training and other requirements needed to achieve and maintain these levels are discussed in subsequent sections.  

1. Official in Training
2. Provisional
3. Regional
4. Junior National
5. National

## Officiating Non-Sanctioned Tournaments
When a referee accepts a tournament assignment at an event that is not sanctioned by the NCVA or other USAV entity, the referee assumes liability and other insurance responsibilities. If a participant, spectator, an official or other person in attendance is injured or has an accident, the tournament host and/or facility manager assumes responsibility for insurance coverage, and referees assume the same responsibility. The NCVA is not involved with any non-sanctioned events. Participants, including referees, must use their own insurance coverage.
