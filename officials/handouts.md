## Time Management

### How to finish or, not to finish, your 10 match day over 1 ½ hours earlier

<div class="--limb1">

* First Match of the day coin toss at 15 minutes before game time.  Unless otherwise instructed, warm up time first match of the day for each team is 5 minutes each, then 3 minutes each for the rest of the day (SERVING included in the three (3) minutes) Prior to the match, if the teams have previously had a playing court exclusively at their disposal, they are entitled to a 6-minute official warm-up period together at the net; if not, they may have 10 minutes. 
* Make sure everyone is ready, and when the server is in possession of the ball, blow whistle and authorize serve as soon as server is on/past the end line. Saving about 40 minutes per day. 
* Not beckoning for service soon enough adds three (3) seconds per service, 120 seconds per set or over 40 minutes per day. 
* Time outs are to last 30 seconds ONLY. ALWAYS have a time piece with you. Saving about 20 minutes per day. 
* An extra 15 seconds per time out at four (4) time outs per set, is, two (2) minutes per match or 20 minutes per day. 
* Do not blow whistle for substitution until new bench player enters the substitution zone. A verbal request for substitution is not acknowledged by the referees. The substitute must enter the substitution zone for the request to be acknowledged, except for a substitution related to an injury. The substitution shall only last the time needed for recording the substitution on the score sheet and allow entry and exit of players. Substitute must be in the substitute zone before R1 whistles for serve, otherwise an improper request. The first improper request by a team in the match that does not affect or delay the game shall be rejected, but it must be recorded on the score sheet without any other consequences, if a change in request is due to a referee’s mind change, the request will be honored, and no sanction assessed. 
* Players chase loose balls not line judges - and they MUST chase them. 
* Change of courts at end of set is three (3) minutes or less. 
* Coin toss for all subsequent matches of the day will be right after conclusion of the current match.  Check and complete the prior match’s paperwork after the coin toss which is during the next match’s warm up time. This can save about 30 minutes per day. 
* An extra three (3) minutes per match getting the next match started is 30 minutes per day.
