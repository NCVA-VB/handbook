## Referee Symposium 
The NCVA is an organization that provides volleyball officials in Northern California and Northern Nevada to all levels of the sport from Middle School to College. If you are interested in becoming an Official (Referee) or are a Club Director/Coach interested in attending the NCVA Symposium, the NCVA offers several Officials Training Symposium each season in January, March, and September at different tournaments.

The Symposiums are multi-day event designed to give the participant actual court/game experience while being mentored by instructors prior to their first match. While rules clinics are valuable tools, the on-court game setting is a good way to give experience needed prior to the start of the season.

The first day of a Symposium is divided into two (2) parts, a hands-on classroom session and an on-court training session.

During the hands-on classroom session, we will introduce the participant to the basics of the game of volleyball. The participants will then review subjects such as Court and Equipment, Match Protocol, Officiating Mechanics, Ball Handling, and Scorekeeping.

During the on-court training, you will experience the atmosphere of a tournament. You will participate in watching a match and, while watching the game, an instructor will answer your questions. This demonstration will help you see, in action, what you just learned in class. Students are then assigned to officiate matches on the second and third day of the tournament. You will work with an experienced official and be debriefed after the match to help you improve before you are ready to work a match on your own.

The Symposium is open to all returning and new referees. Any new referees wanting to work the 2020-2021 Club Season will need to attend a Symposium.

## Officials Advisory Group (OAG)
The Officials Advisory Group (OAG) is a committee of Regional, Junior National, and National officials within the Northern California Region. They are tasked with working with the NCVA to build the officials division, coordinate and run the new officials’ symposiums, and work with their fellow officials in improving their skills and advancing to the next level as an official.
