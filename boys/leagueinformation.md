## Power League Qualifier Seeding 
The Power League Qualifier, not seeding, will determine placement into the {{season_year}} Power League. Every team in the Power League Qualifier will have an opportunity on the court to reach the Gold, Silver or Bronze Division. Teams will be seeded based on their points in {{previous_year}} points.

### Initial Seeding 
- Teams will be seeded based on their points from the {{previous_year}} Power League.
- Teams will be ranked according to the points in their previous age groups. For example, 18’s team will be seeded according to their finish as 17’s team.
- All teams who did not have a corresponding team in {{previous_year}} will be seeded at the bottom of the division.
- 12’s teams will be seeded based on the {{previous_year}} points of their clubs’ 12’s teams.
- Odd-numbered age groups (13’s, 15’s, and 17’s) will be mixed with even-numbered age groups.
  + For example, in the 13/14 division, 13’s teams finished in place numbers 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. 13’s teams in 2019 will be seeded into similar positions in the 13/14 division. Points will be given by each individual age group 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13.  Points in the 18/17, 16/15, 14/13 will not be used.
  + A returning 18’s team without a team in a lower age group will receive a half point from the previous season.

### Unseeded teams 
For the current season, these teams will be seeded from the same age group from last season.  Example: If your club has a 16-1 team playing in the current season but did not have a 15-1 team playing in the previous season, this 16-1 team would be considered “unseeded” team.  For the current season, this “un-seeded” team will be seeded within in the “unseeded” teams based on the club’s 16-1 finish. 

## Power League Region Championships 
The Power League Region Championship division assignments are determined by Power League #4 finish. Teams will be seeded within the division based on points.

### Region Championship Seeding Procedure 
- Teams will receive their Power League #4 points.
- Each Division within an age group will be seeded by points.

## Warm-Ups
- Teams will be given sole use of the court for five (5) minutes prior to their first match of the day.  During the five (5) minutes the team may hit, practice ball handling and serve (serving must be done during their five (5) minutes).  No other time will be allotted to practice serving.  
  + Serving Team – five (5) minutes solo court.
  + Receiving Team – five (5) minute solo court.
- Once all teams in the pool have played, the teams scheduled to play the next match will be given sole use of the court for three (3) minutes.  During the three (3) minutes the team may hit, practice ball handling and serve (serving must be done during their three (3) minutes).  No other time will be allotted to practice serving.
- Since no ball handling is permitted during the opposing team’s use of the court it is recommended that each team provides staggers for the opposing team’s warm-up.  This allows for more reps for the team warming up.  Due to insurance and liability requirements, only NCVA registered and on the roster personnel will be allowed to retrieve balls.
