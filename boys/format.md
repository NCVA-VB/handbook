# Format

## Power League Tournaments 
- The League consists of a two-day Qualifier, three (3) League tournaments, and a two-day Region Championship.  These tournaments are mandatory, which means that a team entering this League will play seven (7) mandatory days.  Upon registering for the League, a team will automatically be entered in each League event.
- Teams entering the League will be divided into divisions (Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.) and age groups based on results from the Qualifier.
- The format for these divisions will be determined by the number of teams entered.  Travel is required for this League.
- The deadline to enter/pay for the League online is {{deadline_powerleague_registration}}.
- There are no refunds after Registration Deadline.
- A team may choose to enter the League after the Qualifier, but they will be entered at the lowest level and only if space is available, at the full Power League cost.
- Points will be awarded to each team based on their results.
- If a team either No Shows, Cancels or Forfeits a tournament, they will receive last place points for that tournament and take the last seed in that division and additional sanctions will be applied.
- Play will begin at {{time_powerleague_play_start}}.
- Each match is the best two-out-of-three sets to 25 points in the first two (2) sets and to 15 points in the third set switching sides at eight (8) points, if necessary.  All sets will use rally scoring with no cap.  Based on format pools may be playing all three (3) sets to 25 Points.
- After pool play, teams advance to playoff brackets. If bracket play cannot be completed by 6:00 PM, the tournament director can change the match format to ONE set to 25 points. Team switch sides when one (1) team reaches 13 points.

<!--
THE SEEDING LANGUAGE WILL LIKELY CHANGE FOR THE 2022 SEASON.
DUE TO COVID, THERE WAS NO SEASON IN 2020, SO "PREVIOUS YEAR" IS REALLY "PREVIOUS YEAR MINUS ONE" (2019)
ONCE WE HAVE A FULL SEASON FOR 2021, WE CAN GO BACK TO USING THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE

## Power League Qualifier Seeding 
Placement into the {{season_year_range}} Power League is determined by Power League Qualifier Finish. Every team in the Power League Qualifier will have an opportunity on the court to reach the Gold, Silver or Bronze Division.

Teams will be seeded based on a combination of 2019 team points and finish in 2021 NCVA/USAV Sanctioned events. Teams without 2019 Power League points will initially be seeded after those with points. Any team that believes a seed is significantly incorrect may [submit a seeding appeal]({{url_powerleague_appeal_form}}). Your written appeal will be considered by NCVA if your appeal states compelling reasons of why your team is mis-seeded and the appropriate calculations for a different seed may occur.

### Initial Seeding
* Teams will be seeded based on their points from the 2019 Power League with a two (2) age group change. **Example:** *NCVA 16-1 will receive NCVA 14-1 Points and based on NCVA 15-1 finish in the 2020 season*.
* All teams who did not have a corresponding team in 2019 or 2020 Season finishes will be seeded at the bottom of the division.

### Appeals
* Teams that believe they are significantly mis-seeded must submit a written appeal to the NCVA Office by the deadline: {{deadline_powerleague_seeding_appeal}}.
* You must turn in the Appeals Form by this date. [This form can be found on the NCVA website]({{url_powerleague_appeal_form}}).

#### Examples of teams that have appropriate reasons to appeal
* A team that is comprised of many players who played with a different club in 2020.
* Appeals should only be submitted when a team’s seeding may be incorrect by at least 35% of the divisions seeding. 

Once the seeding is released for appeals, the ceiling/cap will be removed from the seeded and unseeded teams.  Based on the appeal, team(s) may be moved accordingly.

## Unseeded teams
For the {{season_year_range}} season these teams will be seeded from the same age group from last season. **Example:** *If your club has a 16-1 team playing in the 2021 season but did not have a 14-1 team in 2019 this 16-1 team would be considered an “unseeded” team*. 

## Power League Region Championships 
The Power League Region Championship division assignments are determined by Power League #3 finish. Teams will be seeded within the division based on points.

### Region Championship Seeding Procedure 
- Teams will receive their Power League #3 points.
- Each Division within an age group will be seeded by points.

## Team Movement 
- The top three (3) finishing teams in each League tournament (#1, #2 and #3) will move up one (1) division and the three (3) lowest finishing teams will move down one division.   
- For example, a Silver division team that finishes tenth, eleventh, or twelfth in a League tournament will move to the Bronze division for its next tournament. Likewise, a team finishing first, second, or third in the Bronze division will move to the Silver division.

## Reviewing Points 
The NCVA makes every attempt to [post points]({{url_powerleague_points}}) on the Friday following the last day of play.
