{{file_youthleagueformat}}

## Power League Tournaments 
- The League consists of a two-day Qualifier, four (4) League tournaments, and a two-day Region Championship.  These tournaments are mandatory, which means that a team entering this League will play eight (8) mandatory days.  Upon registering for the League, a team will automatically be entered in each League event.
- Teams entering the League will be divided into divisions (Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc.) and age groups based on results from the Qualifier.
- The format for these divisions will be determined by the number of teams entered.  Travel is required for this League.
- The deadline to enter/pay for the League online is {{deadline_powerleague_registration}}.
- There are no refunds after Registration Deadline.
- A team may choose to enter the League after the Qualifier, but they will be entered at the lowest level and only if space is available, at the full Power League cost.
- Points will be awarded to each team based on their results.
- If a team either No Shows, Cancels or Forfeits a tournament, they will receive last place points for that tournament and take the last seed in that division and additional sanctions will be applied.
Play will begin at {{time_powerleague_play_start}}.
Each match is the best two-out-of-three sets to 25 points in the first two (2) sets and to 15 points in the third set switching sides at eight (8) points, if necessary.  All sets will use rally scoring with no cap.  Based on format pools may be playing all three (3) sets to 25 Points.
After pool play, teams advance to playoff brackets. If bracket play cannot be completed by 6:00 PM, the tournament director can change the match format to ONE set to 25 points. Team switch sides when one (1) team reaches 13 points.

## Power League Qualifier Seeding 
The Power League Qualifier, not seeding, will determine placement into the {{season_year}} Power League. Every team in the Power League Qualifier will have an opportunity on the court to reach the Gold, Silver or Bronze Division. Teams will be seeded based on their points in {{previous_year}} points.

### Initial Seeding 
- Teams will be seeded based on their points from the {{previous_year}} Power League.
- Teams will be ranked according to the points in their previous age groups. For example, 18s team will be seeded according to their finish as 17s team.
- All teams who did not have a corresponding team in {{previous_year}} will be seeded at the bottom of the division.
- 12s teams will be seeded based on the {{previous_year}} points of their clubs’ 12s teams.
- Odd-numbered age groups (13s, 15s, and 17s) will be mixed with even-numbered age groups.
  + For example, in the 13/14 division, 13s teams finished in place numbers 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, etc. 13s teams in 2019 will be seeded into similar positions in the 13/14 division. Points will be given by each individual age group 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13.  Points in the 18/17, 16/15, 14/13 will not be used.
  + A returning 18s team without a team in a lower age group will receive a half point from the previous season.

### Unseeded teams 
For the current season, these teams will be seeded from the same age group from last season.  Example: If your club has a 16-1 team playing in the current season but did not have a 15-1 team playing in the previous season, this 16-1 team would be considered “unseeded” team.  For the current season, this “un-seeded” team will be seeded within in the “unseeded” teams based on the club’s 16-1 finish. 

## Power League Region Championships 
The Power League Region Championship division assignments are determined by Power League #4 finish. Teams will be seeded within the division based on points.

### Region Championship Seeding Procedure 
- Teams will receive their Power League #4 points.
- Each Division within an age group will be seeded by points.
