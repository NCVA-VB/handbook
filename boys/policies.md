## Recruiting Policy 
- The NCVA Boys Division sanctioned season begins {{sanctioned_season_start}} and concludes {{sanctioned_season_end}}. 
- Once a player has committed to a team during the NCVA sanctioned season, club directors and coaches from other NCVA clubs must respect the player’s commitment and cease recruiting the player. If a recruiter contacts a player who has signed a commitment to another team, the player must notify the recruiter of the commitment. After notification, the recruiter shall not contact that player or the player’s family. 
- A recruiting violation occurs when an NCVA registered club director and/or coach from one NCVA registered club makes initial verbal or written (including text messaging or other written forms) contact with an athlete, or the athlete’s parents, from another NCVA registered club with the intent of persuading the player to leave the present club to join another club. 
- If a player or parent makes the initial contact, a club director or coach may inform the player or parent about their specific program without fear of committing a recruiting violation. It is strongly recommended that all club directors and coaches refrain from making negative comments concerning other clubs or their staff. 
- If a club director or coach is found guilty of committing a recruiting violation, the guilty party may make an appeal. A special Board of Inquiry Committee will hear the appeal and will make a ruling. The decision of this Committee will be final. The suggested maximum penalty may include, but is not limited to, a monetary fine and/or a suspension of NCVA membership for a period of one (1) year, beginning on the date of the final ruling. 
 - A player who has committed to a club and then wishes to transfer to another club must follow the NCVA’s Procedure for Player Transfer. This is irrespective of the length of a player’s membership with that club.

- A player can only transfer provided they remain in the same age definition or higher. Example: If you a 16-year-old is playing in the 18s division, you cannot transfer back to the 16s Division. However, if you play on an 18s team and need to transfer to a different club, you can play on a 17s team provided the player is within the USAV Age Definition. 
- Once a team has qualified, or attempted to qualify, for a National Bid to the BJNC that team’s roster is frozen. See USAV website for Frozen Roster Verification Rules.

- Following Power League #4, you cannot transfer a player from one (1) club to another club. 
- If the current club director will not sign the form to release the player, the player or parent may submit a written appeal to the NCVA, and the NCVA League Coordinator will make the necessary contact(s). 
- The NCVA League Coordinator has the right to release the player whether or not the current club director responds. 
- The NCVA League Coordinator also has the right to uphold the current club director’s decision to not grant the player release. In either case, each party has the right to appeal to the Commissioner.

## Player Transfer within a Club 
A team’s roster must remain the same for all NCVA League Tournaments (Qualifier, League Tournaments #1-4, and Regional Championships). However, during the NCVA sanctioned season, a player may transfer from one team to another team within the same club provided it is within the same age category or higher.  A player can only transfer once to a different team and must stay with that team for the remainder of the season. They must also qualify under the Age definition. *Example: If you are a 16-year-old playing in the 18s division, you cannot transfer back to the 16s Division.*
