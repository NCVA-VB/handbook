## 2021 USAV Junior National Volleyball Championships 
For complete information on the JNC’s, check USA Volleyball’s website at {{{url_usav}}}.  Information on dates, divisions, location, and schedule are located on the site along with information on entry costs, procedures, and hotel accommodations. A complete download of the Pre-Tournament Booklet will also be available.  Some of the information may be duplicated on the NCVA website.

USA Volleyball requires all teams to register online through their website at {{url_usav}}. Teams must meet all deadlines or USA Volleyball will not guarantee a team’s entry.  Entry guidelines can be found at {{url_usav}}. In addition, USA Volleyball may require some paperwork to be sent to them to complete the registration process, or teams may be required to deliver the paperwork upon check-in at the tournament.

Teams that earn bids for the Championships must complete all registration processes by the deadline. Earning a bid does not relieve a team of any requirement. Any unused Open bids will be given by USA Volleyball to teams with high placements at the various Bid Tournaments.

All teams participating in the Championships are required by USA Volleyball to have at least one certified second referee, two (2) certified line judges, and a certified scorekeeper. The Rater Request Form can be found online here. In addition, all coaches must be at [Impact]({{url_impact}}) **and** [SafeSport]({{url_safesport}}) certified. Upon request, the NCVA will be providing certification raters during the League tournaments. The form should be submitted to the NCVA Office as soon as possible.
