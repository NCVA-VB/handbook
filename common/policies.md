# **Policies**

## What is a Sanctioned Event? 
Sanctioned events are tryouts, clinics, open gyms, and other club affiliated events that have been approved by NCVA/USAV. These events are governed by the policies set by NCVA/USAV and are covered by the USA Volleyball insurance policy. 

Sanctioned events are required to submit a list of all adults attending each event. These adults are mandated to meet the minimum coaching requirements which include: IMPACT certification, bi-annual SafeSport certification, and bi-annual background screening. Adults failing to meet these requirements are not approved to be present as a participant at the sanctioned event. 

Sanctioned events must also confirm that all participants attending, both adult and junior levels, have a valid membership for the duration of the event. If the event falls over multiple days/weekends, the membership must be valid for the entire time. 

## What is a Non-Sanctioned Event?
Many clubs/teams receive invitations to events hosted by other clubs/teams that are not sanctioned by NCVA and/or USA Volleyball. This indicates they have not requested/been approved for sanctioning and are not covered by USAV policies and insurance. Teams that participate in non-NCVA sanctioned events are playing without USA Volleyball insurance coverage.

Any complaints/claims that would arise, including but not limited to code of conduct violations, code of ethics violations, sexual misconduct, and injury, would fall on the event organizers and/or participants of the event.

Sanctioned competition protects a player’s eligibility for participation in regional, zonal, national, and international competition. For anyone participating, please be diligent in reviewing insurance, waivers and release of liability guidelines beforehand.

## Entering NCVA Tournaments 
Via the NCVA website, if your team has been accepted into a tournament, the NCVA’s goal is to have sites posted and team information by {{deadline_site_posting}}. Exceptions to this will be tournaments that require USA Volleyball’s seeding information or last minute site cancellations. 

## On-Site at NCVA Tournaments 
- All teams, players and coaches, must arrive at the team’s assigned tournament site at least one (1) hour prior to the scheduled start time for the tournament. Teams that may have a bye for the first match of the day are still required to show up one (1) hour prior to the scheduled start time for the tournament. For example, if the scheduled start time for Power League #2 is 8:00 AM, then your entire team should arrive by 7:00 AM.
- Coaches must attend the on-site coaches meeting held 30 minutes prior to match time for all league and non-league events. **Teams who do not attend the meeting will be dropped from the tournament.**
- Teams are responsible for keeping track of the status of play on their assigned court. Teams must be ready to play or officiate as soon as the court is ready to go. Teams failing to be ready on their assigned court will incur sanctions.  

## Recruiting Policy 
- The NCVA {{division}} Division sanctioned season begins on {{date_sanctioned_season_start}} and concludes on the day after the last day of the USA Junior National Volleyball Championships (JNC). Regardless of either event, the conclusion of the {{division}} Division sanctioned season will not extend past {{date_sanctioned_season_end}}.
- Once a player has committed to a team during the NCVA sanctioned season, club directors and coaches from other NCVA clubs must respect the player’s commitment and cease recruiting the player. If a recruiter contacts a player who has signed a commitment to another team, the player must notify the recruiter of the commitment. After notification, the recruiter shall not contact that player or the player’s family.
- A recruiting violation occurs when an NCVA registered club director and/or coach from one (1) NCVA registered club makes initial verbal or written contact with an athlete, or the athlete’s parents, from another NCVA registered club with the intent to persuade the player to leave the present club and join another club.
- The suggested maximum penalty may include, but is not limited to, a monetary fine and/or a suspension of NCVA membership for a period of one (1) year, beginning on the date of the final ruling.
- If a club director or coach is found guilty of committing a recruiting violation, the guilty party may make an appeal. A special Board of Inquiry Committee will hear the appeal and will make a ruling. The decision of this Committee will be final.
- If a player or parent makes the initial contact, a club director or coach may answer questions and inform the player or parent about the club’s specific program without fear of committing a recruiting violation. It is strongly recommended that all club directors and coaches refrain from making negative comments concerning other clubs or their staff.
- A player who has committed to a club and then wishes to transfer to another club must follow the NCVA’s Procedure for Player Transfer. This is irrespective of the length of a player’s membership with that club.

- Following Power League #3, you cannot transfer a player from one (1) club to another club.
- If the current club director will not sign the form to release the player, the player or parent may submit a written appeal to the NCVA, and the NCVA League Coordinator will make the necessary contact(s).
- The NCVA League Coordinator has the right to release the player whether or not the current club director responds.
- The NCVA League Coordinator also has the right to uphold the current club director’s decision to not grant the player release. In either case, each party has the right to appeal to the Commissioner.
- One (1) Club to Club transfer is permitted per season.

## Player Transfer within a Club 
A team’s roster must remain the same for all NCVA League Tournaments (Qualifier, League Tournaments #1-4, and Region Championships).

- However, during the NCVA-sanctioned season, a player may transfer from one (1) team to another team within the same club provided it is within the same age category or higher. A player can only transfer once to a different team and must stay with that team for the remainder of the season. They must also qualify under the Age definition. *Example: If you are a 16-year-old playing in the 18s division, you cannot transfer back to the 16s Division.*
