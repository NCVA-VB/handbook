## Sanctions

### Sanction Penalty Grid
To view the current seasons Sanctions Penalty Grid, please [click here]({{url_sanction_penalty_grid_link}}).

### Background
There has been sufficient abuse of competition privileges by teams in past years to warrant a list of published penalties or sanctions.  The ramifications of these abuses are that gym sites or formats have to be altered at the very last minute.  This has led to lessening the quality of tournaments for those teams who remain involved.  The following sanctions are meant to curtail the cavalier use of the junior tournament structure and to enhance tournament play for all teams. 

### Exceptions
Teams having to cancel from a tournament or that are unable to get to a tournament site due to acts of God and/or weather conditions and road closures will not be sanctioned which will be determined by the NCVA Office.  Teams should notify the NCVA Office, in writing, if this type of situation becomes applicable to them.

### To Cancel from a League or Non-League Tournament 
A team canceling 14 days or more prior to a tournament will not receive a sanction. However, if you cancel 13 days or less prior to the tournament, you will lose your entry fee and possibly other sanctions may apply, see below.  No refunds are given for cancellations out of power league.  You must complete the [online tournament cancellation form]({{url_tournament_cancellation}}).

### Sanction Payments 
All fines must be paid before the sanctioned team/participant may enter into their next NCVA event.  Please be aware of these penalties and take care of them as soon as possible.

### Teams leaving multi-day tournaments early and failing to fulfill all officiating assignments 
Teams that have no flexibility in their travel plans and know they will need to leave before their division completes play will report to the Tournament Director no later than the end of play on the day prior to the final day of Tournament. 

Failure to report to the Tournament Director no later than the end of play on the day prior to the final day of Tournament will result in a team sanction. This sanction will be in the amount of **{{fee_early_departure_sanction_formatted}}**. This sanction will be reported to USA Volleyball and teams will not be able to participate in any future events until paid.

 
### Illegal Player 
An illegal player is one who:  
- Competes under elements of false identification such as name, birth date, club affiliation, etc.
- Competes, but is not registered with the NCVA.
- Competes on two (2) teams in the same tournament. In one (1) event occurs over multiple weekends, a player may only participate on one (1) weekend/division.
- Competes in an event with another team while the player’s original team is being sanctioned for an offense.
  * Illegal players, the team coach, and the club director will fall under the guidelines of the due process procedure. Penalties may range from but are not limited to, immediate suspension of an individual to the suspension of the entire club and monetary fines.


### Age Falsification  
For all NCVA events, any person who alters any document that certifies the age of a participant, or falsifies any statement that lists the age of a participant, will be sanctioned according to the terms listed below. 

Any team representative, coach, club director, or responsible adult who is found to be party to age falsification shall be: 
1. Immediately suspended from registration with NCVA/USA and barred from further participation in the event; and
2. Barred from participation in any NCVA/USA events in any capacity for a minimum of two (2) years; and 
3. Placed on a minimum probation of one additional year, to run consecutively to the suspension. 

Junior players who knowingly play in lower age classifications than which they are eligible or adult players who knowingly play in higher age classifications than which they are eligible shall be: 
1. Immediately suspended from registration with NCVA/USA and barred from further participation in the event; and 
2. Barred from participation in any NCVA/USA events in any capacity for a minimum of two (2) years; and

## Violating the Code of Conduct 
Any participants/attendees found in violation of the code of conduct will be required to attend a behavioral seminar, determined by NCVA, in addition to any other sanctions that may be assessed. Attendance and completion of the behavioral seminar will be at the expense of the person in violation of the code of conduct. Completion of the required behavioral seminar will be required before the person may participate in or attend any future events.  

## Food in the Playing Facility / Failure to Follow Facility Rules 
Tournament directors may impose the “13-Point Rule” for teams who are violating the “No Food in Gym” policy.  The “13-Point Rule” means that in the team’s next set, the score will begin at 0-13, with 13 points automatically awarded to the opposing team.  This will be noted in the tournament director’s report, which will result in the club’s being fined a minimum of **{{fee_food_in_facility_sanction_formatted}}** and receive the last place finish/points if they apply. During the tournaments located in Convention Centers, if your team is caught with food you may be removed from the tournament. 

## Late for an Officiating Assignment 
Tournament directors may impose the following sanction for teams who are late for and/or miss an officiating assignment. Your team’s opponent will be awarded a point a minute for each minute you are late to your officiating assignment, up to 25 points (one set). If this is the last match of the day, then the team may be fined **{{fee_late_to_officiate_formatted}}**. 

## League Commitment 
Once a team has committed to play in the League, the team is automatically entered into each League date. If a team cannot attend a League tournament, the team must still cancel from the tournament by mailing, delivering, faxing, or emailing the [Tournament Cancellation Form]({{url_tournament_cancellation}}), using the criteria stated in this Handbook.  The club will not receive a refund for the cancelled tournament. The team will be placed as the last finisher in that tournament and receive last place points. The team will be dropped to the next division, depending on the League structure. There are no refunds and sanctions may occur if your team does not cancel in the allotted time.  

## Additional Sanctions 
Specific sanctions are mentioned and described in various sections of this Handbook, and in some cases, a specific penalty is associated with a particular violation. In addition, NCVA has the right to impose sanctions with respect to any violation of any other part of this Handbook, or any violation of USA Volleyball’s Code of Ethics, Code of Conduct, Participant Code of Conduct, Eligibility Rules, Substance Abuse Policy, or other policy, as well as any other indiscretions not specifically covered in this Handbook or policies of NCVA or USA Volleyball. The extent and type of sanctions imposed shall be at the sole discretion of the NCVA, subject to the due process procedures described herein.

## Sanction Procedure 
Confirmation of missed officiating assignments, forfeiture of matches, food/drink violations, no-shows, use of illegal players, or any other violations that come to the attention of the tournament director will be communicated by the tournament director to the NCVA Office. The tournament director will also record all offenses on the appropriate forms. After the event in question, the NCVA Office will confirm the offense(s) with the club director and sanctions will be imposed if appropriate. The NCVA Office will record all offenses in the team's folder. 

## Sanction Appeal Process 
Any sanction that does not involve probation, suspension of any duration, or expulsion (severe sanction) shall take effect as soon as it is imposed either by the tournament director or the NCVA office. Any club director or participant who is penalized with a sanction that is not a severe sanction shall have the right to appeal the sanction, by the earlier of either the seventh day after receiving the sanction or the club's or participant's next scheduled event, whichever is first. An appeal shall consist of a letter from the club or participant who has been sanctioned along with any other materials the club or participant chooses to provide. Appeals of non-severe sanctions shall be considered, as soon as reasonably practicable by the NCVA Office, in consultation with the tournament director. NCVA shall provide the club director or participant with written notice of its decision, and there will be no further appeal of the matter. 

Sanctions involving facility rules/policies such as food policies will not be required to identify the persons and/or specific team incurring the sanction. The Tournament Director will determine the club affiliation for the sanction. These Sanctions may not be appealed based on questions regarding the person and/or specific team involved in the incident. While the Tournament Director may choose to notify the Club Director on site at events in Convention Centers, it is not mandatory to do so. The Tournament Director is not required to give a warning for these Sanctions at any time.  

Severe sanctions will be handled under NCVA's due process procedures.
