# Communication
The communication in the NCVA {{division}} Division is as follows, as requested by all Club Directors: 


<div class="--centered">

**Players and Parents &rarr; Coaches &rarr; Club Director &rarr; NCVA Office**

</div>

<div class="--infocallout --centered">

**All NCVA members: When registering online with NCVA, even though it is not a required field, please be sure to provide a phone number and your email address.**

</div>


## NCVA Office 
For continuity, the NCVA Office will communicate with a Club Director or Representative listed under the club console. 

Communications will be made in the same manner to all clubs, with no individual club or group of clubs receiving privileged information from the NCVA office or any tournament personnel. 

In an effort to provide better service, please contact your Club Director/Coach before calling the NCVA. 
 

## Club Director 
- Each club will have only one (1) Club Director or Representative. 
- This Club Director will be the only person in the club who may contact the NCVA Office on matters involving the {{division}} Division. 
- The Club Director or Representative must be a member of the NCVA, pass a background check and be SafeSport certified. 
- <span class="--needsediting">Do we want this to go to Donna's email, or is there another?</span> Any change of Club Director must notify the NCVA Office in writing by emailing [{{email_ncva_donna}}](mailto:{{email_ncva_donna}}) 
 

## Coaches 
Coaches are recommended to contact their Club Director for all junior information. 

If a coach cannot receive appropriate information from the Club Director and the information is not on the NCVA Website, the coach should contact the NCVA Office. 

 
## Players and Parents 
Players and their parents should contact their Coach or Club Director for all {{division}} Division information.  Based on the contract between NCVA and all Club Directors, it is their responsibility to provide you with all required and necessary information. However, if a player/parent cannot receive appropriate information from the Club Director/Coach, the information should be found on the NCVA website. If a parent needs to contact NCVA, please do so via email to {{email_ncva_help}} and include as much detail as possible. You must include the parent’s full name, club name and team affiliation information in order to receive a response. If this information is omitted, you will not receive a response. Emails from parents are responded to on a first-come, first-served basis, usually within three (3) to five (5) business days.   


## Filing Complaints 
The NCVA is willing to investigate complaints that are lodged against various personnel such as club directors, coaches, officials, tournament directors, NCVA staff, or parents, but only if a complaint falls under the jurisdiction of the NCVA. If a complaint does not fall under the NCVA’s jurisdiction, the region cannot act against the person because the NCVA does not have the authority to govern the acts that brought on the complaint. To file a complaint, please view the information below.
