## Protests 
If an explanation of an application or interpretation of a rule is not satisfactory to the team captain, the captain must immediately indicate their disagreement and file a protest prior to the authorization of the next service. If the disagreement with the refereeâ€™s explanation involves the last point of the set, the official protest must be recorded within the first 60 seconds of the times interval between sets. (For 14-and-under competition, the coach may act instead of the captain.) A protest must be called prior to a player going to a tournament director or head official. A parent is not allowed to call a protest. 

- If the final point of the match is disputed, the protest must be recorded before the referees leave the playing area. <span class="--needsediting">The following sentence doesn't make sense to me.</span>(Appointed NCVA Protest Committee/Tournament Director either immediately or prior to the start of the next set).
- It is advisable to have an assigned Protest Committee (Tournament Director) available to rule upon a protest as soon as possible prior to the first service following the protest. Such action should preclude playing the match over from the point of protest if the protest is upheld.

### Protests considered by the first referee (Protest Committee or Tournament Director) include: 
1. Misinterpretation of a playing rule.
2. Failure of the first referee to apply the correct rule to a given situation.
3. Failure to charge the correct penalty-sanction for a given fault.

### Protest facts recorded on the score sheet must include:
1. Score of the set at the time of the protest.
2. Players and positions at the time of the protest.
3. Player substitutions and team substitutions made up to the protest.
4. Team time-outs taken up to the protest.
5. Situation that caused the protest.
6. Signatures of the scorer, captains and first referee, indicating the facts are correct.
