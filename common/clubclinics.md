## Clinic Procedure - Helpful Guide to an Easy Clinic Process 

### Before Clinics 
This process should begin at least **Two (2) weeks** prior to your Clinic dates. 

### Step 1: Gather your information  

- Decide on your clinic
  - Date(s)
  - Time(s)
  - Location(s)
- Submit your completed [Clinic Form]({{url_clinic_sanctioning}}) to the NCVA Office 
- Submit your [Insurance Request Form]({{url_insurance_request}}) for all facilities  
 
### Step 2: Clinic Staff Registration 
We must receive, via email to {{email_ncva_help}}, a list of all adults associated with your clinics.  Any adult who helps in any capacity at the clinics must be a member of the NCVA, pass a background check, Impact Certified, and SafeSport Certified.  Otherwise, the NCVA insurance coverage becomes null and void!  You will receive an email noting which adult will need to have a background check for the upcoming season.

### Step 3: Clinic Passes / Website 
Once the above items are complete, your Clinic information will be posted on the NCVA Website as requested.  We will post your Clinic information, once approved. 

### Step 4: During Clinics 
Each Club Director or Registrar will need to keep a list of ALL participants at the clinic. This list will be submitted to NCVA. The information on the list must include all participantsâ€™ first name, last name and membership number.

### Step 5: Clinic Completion 
After your clinics, you must submit a complete list of attendees to NCVA.  

The list must follow these requirements: 
  - Must include all participants first name, last name and membership number 
  - Submit in Excel format with the following column headers: first name, last name and membership number 
  - Submit via email to {{email_ncva_help}} within 72 hours following the clinic completion  

### Clinic Sanctioning Form  
The Clinic Sanctioning Form can be found and completed online at [{{url_clinic_sanctioning}}]({{url_clinic_sanctioning}})

**All steps included in the Clinic Procedure must be completed before your club clinics will be sanctioned and insured by the NCVA.**
