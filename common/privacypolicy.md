# How we collect Personal Information 
 
## Information that You Provide Us 
In various places on the Site, we request information from you. The exact information we need to collect (including Personal Information) will depend on the purpose for our request. For example, 
if you subscribe to our email list, we collect your email address, first name, and last name. We will indicate  on  the  form  whether  a  particular  field  of  information  is  mandatory  or  optional. If you choose not to provide certain information, we may not be able to provide requested services.

# Disclosure of Personal Information 

We will not disclose Personal Information except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or with your consent. Specifically, we do not sell Personal Information. This section describes to whom we 
disclose Personal Information and for what purposes: 

* Our Service Providers. We employ service providers to perform tasks on our behalf and to assist us in operating the Site or providing our products and services. For example, we engage third  parties to provide analytical services and send out mass communications through our email list. We take commercially reasonable steps to ensure our service providers provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Information as we do.  
* Companies Involved in Mergers and Acquisitions Transactions. If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of our business or assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation), any information collected through the Website, including Personal Information, may be among the items sold or transferred.
* Law Enforcement, Government Agencies, and Courts. We may disclose Personal Information at the request of law enforcement or government agencies or in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes to establish, protect, or exercise our rights or to defend against a legal claim or as otherwise required or allowed by law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety  of any other person. We may also disclose Personal Information to investigate or prevent a violation by you of any contractual or other relationship with us or your illegal or harmful activity. 


# How we protect the confidentiality of Personal Information  
We protect the confidentiality and security of information we obtain in the course of business. We use commercially reasonable safeguards, such as industry-standard encryption technology, to help 
keep the information collected through the Site secure. Despite these efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that our security  measures will prevent third parties such as hackers from illegally obtaining access to Personal Information. We do not represent or warrant that Personal Information about you will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.

# Accessing, updating, or deleting Personal Information 
If you would like to otherwise access, update, or delete Personal Information about you, you may submit a request to privacy@ncva.com. We will promptly review all such requests in accordance 
with applicable law. 

# Opting out of receiving electronic communications  
With your permission, we may send notifications, promotions, or other information via email through a service provider (“Communications”). You may choose to stop receiving Communications by submitting a request to privacy@ncva.com.

# Personal Information transferred from the U.S.  
If you are using the Site from outside the United States, please be aware that Personal Information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States. Although we take steps to provide adequate safeguards, the data protection laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Site, you consent to your information being transferred to the United States for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

# Other Websites and Sites, including Social Media
We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our website, including the information or content contained within them. We encourage you to 
investigate and ask questions before disclosing your Personal Information to third parties.
