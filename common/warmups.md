Donna question - do we leave stuff like this in, or simply refer people to the USAV rule book?

- **Rule 7.2.2b**: “For junior competition, when one team has exclusive use of the court, the other team must either be at its team bench or out of the playing area. Warming up with balls at the team bench or the spectator walkways is not permitted.”
- Since no ball handling is permitted during the opposing team’s use of the court, it is recommended that each team provides shaggers for the opposing team’s warm-up. This allows for more reps for the team warming up. Due to insurance and liability requirements only NCVA registered and on the roster personnel will be allowed to retrieve balls.
