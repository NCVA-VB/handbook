Since no ball handling is permitted during the opposing team’s use of the court, it is recommended that each team provides shaggers for the opposing team’s warm-up. This allows for more reps for the team warming up. Due to insurance and liability requirements only NCVA registered and on the roster personnel will be allowed to retrieve balls.
