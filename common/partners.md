  </div>

  In early summer of 1965, a University of Florida assistance coach sat down with a team of university physicians and asked them to determine why so many of his players were being affected by heat and heat related illnesses. The researchers. - Dr. Robert Cade, Dr. Dana Shires, Dr. H. James Free and Dr. Alejandro de Quesada — soon discovered two key factors that were causing the Gator players to 'wilt': the fluids and electrolytes the players lost through sweat were not being replaced. The researchers then took their findings into the lab precisely balanced carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage that would adequately replace the key components lost by players through sweating and exercise. They called their concoction [‘Gatorade]({{url_gatorade}})'.
