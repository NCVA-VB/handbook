# IMPACT and SafeSport

</div>

## IMPACT 
USA Volleyball SafeSport requires all participating coaches listed on the roster must be IMPACT and SafeSport Certified. The NCVA also recommends that parents and spectators complete SafeSport.  

The primary IMPACT goal is to help all coaches understand and become well-skilled in the awesome responsibility and incredible opportunity they have to influence young people positively through the sport of volleyball.  This course is an offshoot of the Coaching Accreditation Program (CAP), which is under the auspices of the USA Volleyball branch of Educational Programs and Services. 

## SafeSport 
The NCVA would like to assist all coaches in becoming responsible and respectful coaches.   

All {{season_year_range}} IMPACT and SafeSport classes will be completed online.  Please visit the link below to sign up for the USA Volleyball ON-DEMAND courses.

We all have a role to play in providing a healthy setting for our sport. The SafeSport Program raises awareness about possible misconduct in our sport, promotes open dialogue and provides training and resources. When we work as a team, we can build a plan to make volleyball safe – for everyone. 

USA Volleyball is committed to fostering a fun, healthy and safe sport environment for all its members. We must recognize that the safety of minors lies with all those involved in the sport and is not the sole responsibility of any one person at the club, regional or national level.
