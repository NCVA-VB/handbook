## Tie-Breaking Procedure 
### **Two (2) Way Ties**
Two (2) way ties, in match record, in a pool are broken by head-to-head competition results between the two (2) tied teams. 

### **Three (3) Way Ties**
Three (3) way ties in a pool are broken by: 

||||
|---|---|---|
| 1st | Matches | Won/Lost Record |
| 2nd | Sets | Won/lost percentage. Calculation: the team’s total number of sets won divided by the team’s total number of sets played equals the won/lost percentage. The highest percentage wins the pool. |
| 3rd | Point Differential | Determined among the tied teams. Calculation: the team’s total points scored minus the team’s total points allowed in ALL the matches of the pool. |

**Note:** If three teams have the same match record but a different set record, only the teams with identical set records are tied. If match record and set record are the same for all three teams, then point differential will be used to break the tie.
