# **Club Tryouts**

## Parent / Player Guidelines 

### What should a player and his parents expect from a club at tryouts? 

You have the right to make an informed decision. Since your decision is binding for the full season, you should make your choice carefully.

You should be wary of any club that tries to convince you to join while denying you information.

We recommend that you receive the information in writing.

At the very least, you are entitled to the following information from the clubs:

- The opportunity to talk to parents, other players, and/or other programs.
- The opportunity to try out in a future season without discrimination.
- Knowledge about how many spots are available before a tryout begins.
- Clear disclosure of financial obligations.
- A statement of club philosophy.
- Have any questions answered.
- An assessment of your role on the team.
- Disclosure of other players who have accepted and/or been offered spots.
- Information on the coaching staff.
- Description of the teams, goals, practice schedule, and tournament schedule.
- Try out for more than one club.
- Time Commitment.
- Travel Commitment.
- Travel Policy for overnight stay.
- Social Media Guidelines.
- SafeSport Guidelines.
- COVID Protocols

Parents - you may view our Parents link located on {{url_ncva}} on the top tool bar for general information, in the Parents Handbook.

Make sure you are aware of all recruiting rules and regulations following your commitment to your club.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Northern California office at **{{phone_ncva}}** or email us at {{email_ncva_help}}.

## Tryout Policy for the {{season_year_range}} Season
### Policy 

Each year the tryout policy is reviewed by the Board of Directors. They have reviewed the alternative solutions and suggestions given to the NCVA from club directors, coaches and parents. The decision has been made to keep the current policy intact. The approved tryout dates for the {{season_year_range}} season are: 

<span class="--needsediting">{{date_tryouts}}</span>

#### Only One Letter of Commitment Permitted
A player who signs more than one Letter of Commitment with more than one club is subject to suspension for the entire {{season_year_range}} season. 

#### Verbal Commitments
A player may commit verbally to a club before the second Sunday in November. A verbal commitment is not binding. The player may revoke the commitment at any time, before signing a Letter of Commitment, without penalty. 

#### Recruiting Ban after Signing
I understand that all clubs are obligated to respect my signing and shall cease to recruit me upon my signing this document. I shall notify any recruiter who contacts me that I have signed. 

#### Club Signatures Required Prior to Submission
This document must be signed and dated by the Club Director before submission to me and my parents (or legal guardian) for our signatures. 

#### Parent/Guardian Signature Required
My parent or legal guardian is required to sign this Letter of Commitment if I am less than 21 years of age at the time of signing. 

#### Falsification of Letter of Commitment
If I falsify any part of this Letter of Commitment, including the date, I understand that I am subject to suspension for the entire {{season_year_range}} season. 

#### Nullification of Other Agreements
My signature on this Letter of Commitment nullifies any agreements, verbal or otherwise, which would release me from the conditions stated within this document. 

#### Binding Agreement
I understand that I have signed this Letter of Commitment with the club and not with a particular individual. If the coach or any player(s) leaves the team, I remain bound by the provisions of this document. If a club makes dramatic material changes from what was promised, then it may be grounds for a release from the commitment. Examples include, but are not limited, to significant changes in practice schedule, practice location, tournament schedule. 

### Violations 
The following sanctions apply directly to the person(s) violating the policy:
  - The penalty for the first violation will be suspension from all NCVA/USA competition for a minimum of one (1) week up to a maximum of one (1) month, depending on the severity of the violation. Multiple offenses arising from the same incident (e.g., multiple players on the same team) will incur separate penalties.
  - The penalty for the second violation will be suspension from all NCVA/USA competition for a minimum of one (1) month up to a maximum of one (1) year, depending on the severity of the violation.  Multiple offenses arising from the same incident (e.g., multiple players on the same team) will incur separate penalties.

All suspensions begin on the date of the first competition following the violation for the penalized person(s). <span class="--needsediting">All to begin with the first tournament of the season. </span>

If any person fails to adhere to the terms of a sanction, the individual will be suspended from NCVA competition and National level events for one (1) calendar year and subject to a lifetime ban. Furthermore, the coaching staff of the team on which the person is registered will be suspended from NCVA competition and National level events for one (1) calendar year and subject to a lifetime ban. In the event the individual is the club director, all coaches in the club will be suspended from NCVA competition and National level events for one (1) calendar year and subject to a lifetime ban.

### Tryout Membership 
We recommend you send the following information to all players attending your tryouts:  

All players attending NCVA Sanctioned tryouts must have a full membership (**{{fee_membership_full}}**) or a tryout pass (**{{fee_membership_tryout}}**). Tryout passes are good for all tryouts that a player attends. Tryout passes do not extend past tryouts, once tryouts are completed you will need to pay the full **{{fee_membership_full}}** for a full membership. To attend NCVA Sanctioned tryouts, you need to register online with NCVA. 

We recommend if you are certain that your athlete will make a team, please consider purchasing the full **{{fee_membership_full}}** membership instead, because the **{{fee_membership_tryout}}** will not carry over and count for the **{{fee_membership_full}}**. therefore, you may be paying **{{fee_membership_excessive}}** in the end with both membership costs.

To register for the tryout, pass or full membership: 

- Go to {{url_ncva}}
- Scroll to the bottom of the home page and select “Register as A Member".
- Select New or Renewing Member.
  - If a new member, begin completing the form.
  - If a renewing member, enter your login and select renew online.

### Tryout Procedure 
All tryout procedures and policies will need to be followed whether you are having a tryout or not. This entails waiting until the specified signing date to sign players, collect uniform sizes, collect forms and/or payments. 

#### Teams holding a Tryout 
We would like to make the tryout procedure as easy as possible. Please follow the instructions below and should you have any questions on the procedure, contact the [NCVA Office]({{email_ncva_help}}).
