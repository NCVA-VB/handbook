# NO DINX/NCVA High Performance &mdash; Indoor
In conjunction with USA Volleyball, the NCVA will continue our Region High Performance program. Participating athletes will represent our region in an inter-regional USA Volleyball High Performance Championship tournament in July. The goal of the High-Performance Program is to provide volleyball athletes with the best coaching and competition available in Northern California. 

This is the 19th year for our High Performance Program.

**Members of NCVA High Performance teams will have the opportunity to:**

* Compete with the best athletes in the country within their age groups both in the USA.
* Play with some of the best athletes in Northern California.
* Receive top quality coaching and instruction.
* Learn USA Volleyball systems and techniques.
* Increase individual visibility, particularly for those from club teams with low exposure. 

## Information for Players

The goal of the High Performance Program is to provide volleyball athletes with the best coaching and competition available in Northern California. Many athletes attend the National Tryout to compete with the best athletes in and around the Region. Attending a National Tryout can help to increase an athlete’s visibility, particularly if he/she plays for a team that does not get much exposure to collegiate recruiting.

In addition to outstanding coaching and competition, selected High Performance players will receive:

* All participants receive a t-shirt at tryouts supplied by our sponsor [No Dinx]({{url_nodinx}}).
* Team members will receive two (2) jerseys and one (1) pair of shorts. Your tryout t-shirt will become your practice shirt.
* Your name on the NCVA website as a player on the NCVA High Performance Team.


## Team Selection and Practices

Our goal is to select all of the High Performance Teams early, so the NCVA can work with each team on fundraising to pay for the trip.

Team selection will **begin** on **{{date_hpteam_selection_startdate}}** and **end** on or before **{{date_hpteam_selection_enddate}}**. Players will be notified via email of selection.  Once confirmed, rosters are posted online. Teams will be finalized by **{{date_hpteam_finalization_date}}**.

A tentative practice schedule can be found online. Teams usually practice two (2) days in June and three (3) days in July. Practice schedule and site assignments are not finalized until the team has been selected. This way we can choose the best site to better accommodate the players.
