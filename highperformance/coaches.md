## Invitation to All Coaches
This is the 19th year for our Girl’s High Performance Program.

## Team Coaches
Our plan is to field one (1) team to attend the USA Indoor High Performance Championship in the following age groups divisions:

* Mens' International Junior
* Womens' International Junior
* Girls’ International Youth
* Boys’ National Youth
* Girls’ National Youth
* Girls’ National Select
* Boys’ Regional
* Girls’ Future Select
  
We plan to have two (2) coaches for each team—one (1) head coach and one (1) assistant. All expenses and a stipend will be paid to head and assistant coaches.

If you are interested in becoming part of the High Performance program, these are the recommended requirements for head or assistant coaches:

* Good organizational skills.
* Willingness to adapt skill-training philosophy to coincide with that used by USA Volleyball National Teams and the USA High Performance Program.
* Willingness and ability to evaluate talent without bias to an athlete’s previous experience or organizational affiliation.
* At least three (3) years of experience as head coach of a high level high school, club, or college program.
* At minimum, be IMPACT-SAFESPORT certified (assistant coach) with a Cap I or Cap II Level preferred (head coach).
  
Once involved in the program, coach’s requirements are as follows:

* Agreement to submit to a background check.
* Must be available for all scheduled events (see list of events) including all tryout dates, practices as scheduled and the dates of the tournament.
* Agreement to coach a team.
* Agreement to follow all NCVA procedures and policies.
* Willingness to set aside other affiliations in order to provid unbiased coaching experience.
* Act as a representative of the NCVA and all Northern California Volleyball Clubs, Coaches and Players.
  
If this interests you, please send your resume by mail, fax, or [email to the NCVA office](mailto:{{email_ncva}}). If selected, you will be notified promptly to set up an interview. Coaches will be selected on the basis of how well they will represent the NCVA, what attributes/qualities they have to give to the program and how well they will work with the players. Coaches of the High Performance program are to act professional at all times and represent the NCVA in the best manner possible.
